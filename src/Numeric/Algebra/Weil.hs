{- | Weil algebra.

Weil algebra \(W\) is a \(R\)-algebra together with a unique maximal ideal \(\mathfrak{M}\), which is nipotent and \(W = \mathbb{R} \oplus \mathfrak{M}\) holds.

There are some good characterisation of Weil algebra; the following are equivalent:

  1. \(W\) is a Weil algebra,
  2. \(W\) is isomorphic to a quotient \(\mathbb{R}[X_1, \dots, X_n]/I\) of polynomial ring, and there exists \(k\) such that \(X_1^{k_1} \dots X_n^{k_n} \in I\) for all \(k_1 + \dots + k_n = k\),
  3. \(W\) is isomoprhic to a quotient \(\mathbb{R}[\![X_1, \dots, X_n]\!]/I\) of a ring of formal power series, such that \(I \supseteq (X_1, \dots, X_n)^k\) for some \(k\).
